# Angular Renaissance Fundamentals Workshop

In this workshop, we develop an Angular Renaissance application (Angular 17+ until today) from scratch, introducing the fundamental concepts of Angular 17+ development, tailored for developers who have never built web applications with Angular before.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM â€“ we recommend using [NVM (Linux/Mac)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [NVM-Windows (Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- Install Angular CLI via `npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Installation

### Install Angular

Refer to the [official Angular installation documentation](https://docs.angular.lat/guide/setup-local#instalar-la-cli-de-angular).

In summary, to install Angular CLI, execute the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Install the Angular Fundamentals Workshop

1. `git clone git@github.com:puntotech/angular-renaissance-fundamentals-workshop.git`
2. `cd angular-renaissance-fundamentals-workshop`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`

The `npm start` script invokes the `serve:all` command, which runs the `serve:api` and `serve:web` commands concurrently. Of course, you can invoke each command separately if necessary.

```json
"start": "npm run serve:all",
"serve:web": "ng serve --port 4200 --open",
"serve:api": "npm --prefix <path> run <command>",
"serve:all": "concurrently \"npm run serve:api\" \"npm run serve:web\"",
```

The web application will open in [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

The API will be available at [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/) starting from the [06.01-http](https://github.com/puntotech/angular-renaissance-fundamentals-workshop/tree/61.01-http) branch.

## How to Complete the Workshop

The repository is organized into numbered branches (`01`, `02`, `03`, ...), which represent the steps to follow in the workshop. The first step is branch `01`, followed by `02`, and so on.

Each branch has a specific name defining the concept presented in that branch. The README files in these branches describe the Angular concept and include a challenge to solidify understanding.

Finally, branches containing the solution to the challenges have the `-solved` suffix.

For example, the first concept is found in the branch [01.01-single-component](https://github.com/puntotech/angular-renaissance-fundamentals-workshop/tree/01.01-single-component), and its solution is in [01.01-single-component-solved](https://github.com/puntotech/angular-renaissance-fundamentals-workshop/tree/01.01-single-component-solved).

## API

The workshop requires a backend to provide data to the frontend application. A Node.js backend is provided in the `api` directory. The API uses in-memory data storage, so data is reset each time the backend restarts.

To run the API independently, follow these steps:

1. `cd api`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start:dev`

Alternatively, if you run the `npm start` script, the API will start concurrently with the Angular web application.

## Branches

The available branches are as follows:
